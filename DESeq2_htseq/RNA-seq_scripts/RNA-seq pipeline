RNA-seq pipeline with a few script files used in this work.

1. Download NCBI GEO GSE104775 dataset ( all 72 samples ) by Prefetch & FASTQ-dump 

2. Check quality control by FASTQC

3. Trimmming by trimmomatic ( trmming.sh ) 
   
3. Alignments
   1) Build Hisat2 grcm38_tran package
   2) Hisat2 alignments on GRCm38.93 annotations by 'hisat2.sh' script
 
4. Evaluation of raw counts by HTSeq
   1) Obtain raw counts files by 'htseq.sh' script
   2) Combine all data by 'htseq_cout.py' 
   
5. 2nd alignments and raw counts
   1) Extract Unmapped FASTQ files by 'Unmapped_FASTQ.sh'
   2) 2nd alignments on GRCh38.93 annotations by 'hisat2_2nd.sh'
   3) Obtain raw counts file by 'htseq_2nd.sh'
   4) Extract raw counts for three human genes (APP, PSEN1, TREM2)
   5) Combine raw counts profiles ( Mouse & Human ) as 'Raw_counts_from_HTSeq_w_HumanGenes.csv'

6. Differently expressed genes by DESeq2 R script file ( DEG_by_DESeq2.R )
